ASSUMPTIONS

1. The two rovers are allowed to occupy the same space (Mars is a big planet)
2. If the rover is about to come off the grid, we should stop it from doing that, assuming that 
   the grid is a safe area for the rover to explore
3. The starting position of the rover needs to be within the grid, if it is not that is an invalid use case
4. Inputs are expected to be in upper case, but if it is not, the program will still accept it
